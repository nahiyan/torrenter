= Add a New Torrent

To start downloading from a torrent, you need to add it to Torrenter.
There are two ways to add a torrent to Torrenter:

* Torrent file
* Torrent magnet URI

== Adding Torrent through a Torrent File

*Torrent file* is a regular file which contains all the information required to load a torrent, and start downloading data associated with the torrent.

There are two ways to do it:

* Main menu
** Torrent > Add from File

== Adding Torrent through a Torrent Magnet URI

*Torrent magnet URI* is a piece of text which contains all the information required to load a torrent, and start downloading data associated with the torrent.

There are two ways to do it:

* Main menu
