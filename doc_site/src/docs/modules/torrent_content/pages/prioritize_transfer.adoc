= Prioritize Transfer

A torrent may have several content items, which are essentially just files and directories/folders; on top of that, it all can be deeply nested too.

You can prioritize content items as you desire, which is likely to affect their transfer rates - that is, content items with higher priority is likely to get higher download rate. You can also skip download of specific content items through this way.

You can set priority of content items with the following steps:

* Torrent details view > Content
** Right click on the content item in the contents table
** In the context menu, you can click on any of the menu items inside *Priority*

TIP: Note that there is also a checkbox for each content item.
This is a shortcut of setting priority to *Don't download*.

CAUTION: Checking/unchecking a content item will not just change its own priority, but also its children.
