= Force Reannounce

Announcing is a way to communicate with the trackers associated with a torrent. To announce is to essentially send a request to the tracker. The request triggers the tracker to respond with information regarding peers.

Every BitTorrent client announces to the trackers, numberous times, during the course of a download to update information regarding peers. It all happens automatically, usually over a fixed interval.

However, you can manually trigger a reannounce by forcing it through:

* Torrents table context menu
** Right click on the torrent in the torrents table
** Click *Force Reannounce* in the context menu
