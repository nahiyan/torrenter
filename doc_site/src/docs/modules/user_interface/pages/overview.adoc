= Overview

Torrenter's interface is composed of a window, along with a main menu. The window consists of a header, with bunch of buttons. The body consists primarily a table, which lists all the torrents loaded.

Selecting a torrent in the table brings up another view at the bottom of the body - displaying details specific to the selected torrent; it's called *Torrent Details View*. If no torrent is selected, torrent details view disappears.
