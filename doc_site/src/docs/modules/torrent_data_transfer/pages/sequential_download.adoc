= Download Sequentially

Each torrent is composed of equi-sized pieces.
Sequential download is a way of downloading the pieces sequentially.
If a torrent is quite healthy, and has good number of seeds and peers, Torrenter will automatically download the pieces sequentially for performing disk I/O operations efficiently.
However, if the torrent isn't healthy, downloading sequentially may significantly decrease the transfer rate. A notable use of sequential download is for streaming videos.

There is one way to enable/disable sequential download:

* Torrents table context menu
** Right click on the torrent in the torrents table
** Click *Download in Sequential Order* in the context menu
