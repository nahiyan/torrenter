= Limit Transfer Rate

There are times when you need to constrain the transfer rate - be it upload or download rate.

You can set transfer rate by the following way:

* Torrents table context menu
** Right click on the torrent in the torrents table
** Click *Limit Download Rate*, or *Limit Upload Rate*, in the context menu

You can set transfer rate as _unlimited_, or constrained by a hard upper limit.
